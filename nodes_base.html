<h3> <strong> What is an Open Node?</strong></h3>
<h2>Use these at your own risk!</h2>
<p>The MyntNote software architecture allows for an easy way to use MyntNote without downloading the entire blockchain.
This is called "using a remote node". Essentially, your wallet program connects to someone elses monerod (blockchain) program, a.k.a "node" a.k.a. network service</p>
<p>It is somewhat slower, and there is some information leak, <a href="http://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/38/what-privacy-or-security-trade-offs-are-associated-with-not-running-your-own-ful">as detailed here.</a></p>
<p>That being said, no one can steal your monero because you use a remote node. </p> 
<h1>You should really run your own node</h1>
<p>Its honestly not that hard - it can take 40 minutes to synchronize if you have a SSD and a good internet connection. Also, these remote nodes are NOT reliable. A lot of times they just won't connect, because the software really wasn't made for this.</p>
<p>Download your node software here: <a href="https://getmonero.org/downloads/">MyntNote.org</a> and learn how to run the software <a href="https://MyntNote.org/getting-started/running">here</a></p> 
<br>
<p>MyntNote maintains two different collections of open nodes. One is a collection of random nodes - anyone can offer their node up for inclusion, and MyntNote will detect it and include it. These are the Random Nodes seen below.</p>
<p>The second type of open node are those listed as web addresses, like node.myntnote.org. There are limited nodes in these addresses, and their status isn't checked (yet). So they may be down.</p>
<h3>Please consider donating if you use these open nodes.</h3>
<p>I run some of them, others run others.</p>

<h1>Random Nodes!</h1>
<p>MyntNote runs a <a href="https://github.com/Gingeropolous/moneriote">script<a/> every 30 minutes to  scan the MyntNote network for open nodes. Click the button to get an IP address of a random one!</p>
<input type="button" id="btnSearch" value="Get Random Node!" onclick="GetValue();" />
<p>Note that these nodes use port 124091.</p>
<p id="message" >Press The Button!</p>
<p>There are <span id="numnodes">this many random nodes</span> available</p>
<br>
<p> To use with monero-wallet-cli, just use these commands </p>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p><kbd>monero-wallet-cli.exe --daemon-address <span id="windows-node-ip">ADDRESS.OF.HOST</span>:24091</kbd></p>
<h3>Unix-type (ubuntu, MacOS)</h3>
<p><kbd>./monero-wallet-cli --daemon-address <span id="unix-node-ip">ADDRESS.OF.HOST</span>:24091</kbd></p>
<br>
<h3>MyntNote GUI</h3>
<p>To use with the MyntNote GUI, enter the node address here (or the ip address). Be sure to enter the proper port!

<h3>Non-random MyntNote Open Node Addresses</h3>
<p>How does it work? the open node addresses actually point to many different nodes - when you request one, one in the list is selected. So if it doesn't work once, just try again.</p>
<br>
<p><kbd>--daemon-host node.xmrbackb.one</kbd></p>
<p>A high speed node network maintained by Snipa, developer and maintainer of xmrpool.net</p>
<p><kbd>--daemon-host node.myntnote.org</kbd></p>
<p>Largest list of open nodes. This includes the geo-located nodes below.</p>
<p><kbd>--daemon-host eu.myntnote.org</kbd></p>
<p>Nodes in Europe.</p>
<p><kbd>--daemon-host uk.myntnote.org</kbd></p>
<p>Nodes in United Kingdom</p>
<p><kbd>--daemon-host uswest.myntnote.org</kbd></p>
<p>Nodes in US Western</p>
<p><kbd>--daemon-host asia.myntnote.org</kbd></p>
<p>Nodes in Asia</p>

<p>If you would like to offer your node up for inclusion in the MyntNote Network of Open Nodes, you have two options.</p>
<p>Option 1: you can simply add the following code to the launch of your daemon (and open your firewall), and the MyntNote script will sniff you out and add your node to the random list</p>
<p><kbd>--rpc-bind-ip YOUR.EXTERNAL_IP.GOES.HERE --rpc-bind-port 24091 --restricted-rpc --confirm-external-bind</kbd></p>
<p>Option 2: You can ask to be added to one of the address collection. There is limited space in these, so I only add high reliability nodes. You still need to launch your daemon with some special flags, and then please email me at gingeropolous@tutanota.com to ask me to add the node.</p>
<p><kbd>--rpc-bind-ip YOUR.EXTERNAL_IP.GOES.HERE --rpc-bind-port 24091 --restricted-rpc --confirm-external-bind</kbd></p>
